# CART-263 Project2

This is my 2nd project for CART-263, and for it I have decided to create an audio reactive visualizer which can serve as a contrast to the audio reactive visualizer I previously created for CART-253. My previous visualizer was very abstract and was designed with high energy kind of music in mind, but this visualizer is supposed to be relaxing, to help calm one down. This is why I chose to design this visualizer to be calm, natural setting (a tree, night sky, and waves) which reacts to audio.

I was inspired to make my visualizer based on a natural scene because of the book Design In Nature by Adrian J. Bejan and J. Peder Zane. The entirety of their book is about patterns in evolve over time and what they call the Constructal Law. One of my favourite kinds of patterns discussed in this book are flow patterns, which is what you see in tree branches, veins, lightning, river systems and so on. So, I began researching videos on coding natural patterns, which brought me to Dan Shiffman from http://codingtra.in. Not only did I became a huge fan, but I also found some great starting points for realizing my plans for this project. (I've attached links to the videos of Dan Shiffman's which inspired me and gave me the base of my scene at the bottom of my README file).

The music used in this project is a song I wrote, recorded and produced myself a couple weeks ago using Logic Pro X, and was an experiment of mine with different styles of music than I usually make.

- The song is started by clicking on the canvas
- The tree can be controlled by pressing the arrow keys
