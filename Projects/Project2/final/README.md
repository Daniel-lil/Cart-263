# CART-263 Project2

This is a progress report for my 2nd project for CART-263
it is the start of a program which will draw a scene and
animate that scene to go along with a song.

The song is started by clicking on the canvas

The start for the star and tree aspects of my program were inspired by Dan Shiffman from http://codingtra.in, specifically from these videos
