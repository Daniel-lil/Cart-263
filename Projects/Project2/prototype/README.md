# CART-263 Project2

This is a progress report for my 2nd project for CART-263
it is the start of a program which will draw a scene and
animate that scene to go along with a song.
The scene is currently only made up of a tree and stars
with only the stars being animated but later there will
be a moving ground/terrain and the tree will also be animated to the music

The song is started by clicking on the canvas
