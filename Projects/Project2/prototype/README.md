# CART-263 Project2

This is a progress report for my 2nd project for CART-263
it is the start of a program which will draw a scene and
animate that scene to go along with a song.
The scene is currently only made up of a tree and stars
with only the stars being animated but later there will
be a moving ground/terrain and the tree will also be animated to the music

The song is started by clicking on the canvas

The start for the star and tree aspects of my program were inspired by Dan Shiffman from http://codingtra.in, specifically from these videos
