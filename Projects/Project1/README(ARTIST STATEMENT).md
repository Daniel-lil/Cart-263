Cart 263 Project1: The Deactivation of HAL 9000
By: Daniel Little

DESCRIPTION

  With this program the user becomes the Protagonist of Stanley Kubrick's movie, 2001: A Space Odyssey. The user has to disable the evil artificial intelligence system HAL 9000 by undoing screws. The user's index finger is tracked by their computer's camera and is drawn on the screen as a screwdriver.
  Holding the tip of the screwdriver over a screw for 5 second will unscrew the screw.

LIBRARIES USED

  I chose this scene from this particular movie in large part due to how well I could imagine it
  translating into an interactive program through the utilization of the technology we've been shown in this class. For example, I used the ResponsiveVoice library to play HAL's robotic voice, the ml5-Handpose Model to track the user's hand so that it could be used as a screwdriver, and p5.sound to play the breathing sound effects. These various libraries were extremely useful when it came to making the user feel more engaged with this program. I feel as though the ResponsiveVoice library allowing the program to say the user's name, the user being able to use their own body to control the program with ml5, and also the use of p5.sound to play the breathing sounds, very much puts the user in the place of Dave from 2001 and makes the interactivity more personal.

FUN FACT

  After I showed my Dad this program he told me that the reason the acronym HAL was chosen was because if all the letters were moved over one place in the alphabet it'd spell IBM.
